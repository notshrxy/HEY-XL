VENV (VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT) - PYTHON, FOLDER LOCALLY USED DURING DEVELOPMENT.

The venv folder contains a virtual environment used to manage Python dependencies locally.
It’s ignored in .gitignore because it’s system-specific — you can recreate it anytime with:

python -m venv venv #2nd 'venv' indicates name of the venv, here - 'heyxl'
pip install -r requirements.txt
