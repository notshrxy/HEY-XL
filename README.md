# 🤖 HEY-XL – Voice-Driven Excel Automation

HEY-XL is a **voice-activated Excel automation assistant** that allows users to perform spreadsheet operations using natural speech commands.  
From adding marks to updating records, HEY-XL simplifies data entry and manipulation through intelligent voice interaction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Designed primarily for educational and workspace productivity, HEY-XL combines **speech recognition**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **Excel automation** to execute user commands in real-time.

Users can say commands like:
> “Add 85 for Priya in DSA”  
> “Update Rahul’s attendance to 92 percent”

HEY-XL processes the voice input, interprets intent, and updates Excel sheets instantly — making manual typing a thing of the past.
